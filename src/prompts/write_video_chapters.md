## How to Write Video Chapters

### Steps
1. Watch or review the video to understand its content and flow.
2. Identify natural breakpoints in the content (e.g., topic changes, new sections).
3. Create a list of chapters with timestamps and optional links.

### Example Output
{chapter 1 name} – [0:00](chapter-link)
{chapter 2 name} – [0:45](chapter-link)
{chapter 3 name} – [2:00](chapter-link)
{chapter 4 name} – [6:00](chapter-link)
...

### Guidelines
- Each chapter must be **at least 20 seconds** long.
- The first 1–3 chapters can be shorter due to introductions or quick transitions.
- Avoid creating too many chapters — aim for clarity over granularity.
- Chapter titles should be concise and descriptive of the content.
