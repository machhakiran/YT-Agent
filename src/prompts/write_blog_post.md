## How to Write a Blog Post

### Blog Structure

- Short engaging title (format with markdown `#`)
- Short engaging subtitle that compliments title (format with markdown `###`)
- 2–3 sentence hook that clearly states the reader benefit, no header.
- `---` (section break)
- **Introduction**: Three short paragraphs, no header.
- **Body**: Multiple sections with clear, punchy headers. 
    - Note: Each section in body should have 2 paragraphs (3 max when necessary).
- **Ending**: A final section titled *Conclusion*, *Takeaways*, or *What's Next?*

### Writing Guidelines

- Most paragraphs should be 2 sentences (3 max when necessary).
- Use one of these story structures for posts, sections, and even paragraphs:
  - *Status quo → Problem → Solution*
  - *What? → Why? → How?*
  - *What? → So what? → What now?*
- Use plain language that’s easy for most people to understand.
